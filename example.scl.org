top layer: concurrency with functions for everything else
  bash
  process [function f (x, y, z) returns w throws v]
2nd layer: GOTO
  inside a component
  while(...) { ... }
  if ... then ... else .. fi
  function f (x, y, z) returns w throws v

3rd layer: code

system: 2 lamps (fbp)
each lamp (state diagram)
state diagram transpiles -> js
js compiles -> assembler
assembler assembles -> binary
